## 🔍 Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Normalized numerical values  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Studied correlations between features and price  
   - Visualized key factors influencing car prices  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented regression models:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Decision Tree Regressor  
     - Random Forest Regressor  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: R² Score, RMSE  
   - Compared model performance to select the best one  

---

## 🚀 Results  
- The **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best with high accuracy.  
- Identified **engine size, horsepower, and curb weight** as the most significant factors influencing price.
